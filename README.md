But many in the country, including Mr Snyman, who founded the organization People Against Racial Classification (Parc) in 2010, believe the use of the categories has no place in a democratic South Africa.
white people continue to dominate the economy in terms of ownership and decision-making power.
government can only measure progress through statistics based on the old categories.
continued use of racial classification to monitor change has led to the hardening of the categories.
the dominance of a racial identity has prevented the forging of a truly common identity. - Dr. Saths Cooper

South Africa has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the world
22% of coloured south Africans are unemployed (lower than the black majority)
Avoiding Gangs is a huge problem
Many students finish matrit ( I assume middle or highschool) and dont have a job
Unemployed students stand on corners to receive jobs as drug dealers
Most students in highschool especially girls use drugs (usually crystal meth)
The police largely target taking down drug dealers (the community has felt safer because it means less shootings)
Young people lose a sense of purpose and hope leaving them vulnerable to gang recruitment

The Colored community doesnt have a clear sense of what makes them different, but they are able to identify this subconounciously

A large amount of discrimination against not being white enough or black enough

Lots of cultural stereotypes and confusion regarding race

Education


Personas -

Tau Dlamini
Age: 12
Gender: Male

Tau has started to get picked on at school and feels that being coloured is nothing to be proud of. He doesnt have a lot of role models especially since his family lives in a white neighborhood. He feels lucky to go to a good school and to have such hard working parents, but feels like those at school see him as a failure.  


Patricia Ndlovu
Age: 4 
Gender Female

Patricia is a fun energetic kid who loves to go to school and learn to read/write. She goes to a school where there are mostly black students. Patricia loves to spend time with her  younger brother and enjoys to paint, color, and read aloud at home. Her mom worries that in the future patricia may not fit in as well with the community because of the families skin color, but wants patricia to be proud of her culture and heritage.

Figma Prototype - https://www.figma.com/file/N7CP3CXE9cjMDxVrsrKoS7/Colourful?node-id=0%3A1

Description: Colourful is a desktop interface where coloured kids can read, paint, and order inspired works to help promote diversity and acceptance. The Goal of Colourful is to start coloured kids early in knowing that they can live up to many great things. To help encourage their understanding of ethnic diversity and to see that being different is something to be proud of. Because of the large amount of features on this website I wanted to be sure that it mostly was used for kids of any age between 5 and onward. Youâ€™ll see that the reading book section is a little more detailed as I would suspect parents reading these books to their kids or 10-12 year olds picking up chapter books.
